# Variable-Length Subnet Mask Calculator in Java

Accepts a CIDR-formatted network address and individual subnet parameters to calculate individual subnet sizes, ranges, and addresses.

The source code is a complete disaster. I am a beginner trying to implement design patterns (MVC) beyond my level. I need to work on the basics first.
